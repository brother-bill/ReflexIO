## Description
ReflexIO is a game that helps you warmup your right click movement.

- Select a difficulty
- Dodge enemy projectiles
- Highscore Timer + Click Counter

## Implementation
The most difficult part of creating this game was to ensure everyone has the same experience regardless of what computer and resolution they are using. My solution is far from perfect.

## Running Tests
Tests were run using mocha and chai to test the math for some of my calculations. 
Run the following commands in the root folder:

```
npm install
npm run test
```
